This is a selfbot made by me!
It's got quite a few commands. Use help and help2 for a list of commands. I recommend using the selfbot in servers with embed perms given. Many of the commands 
are embed relied. 

***First thing you should do is download all the files***

**Steps**
1.Download latest nodejs: https://nodejs.org/dist/v15.14.0/node-v15.14.0-x64.msi
2.Then, do their setup untill it's finished. 
3.Next, use 7zip or winrar to extract the zip 
4.Now, a folder should appear.
5.Open the folder and edit config.json. The only necessary things are token and prefix for the commands
6. Then Run the "install.bat" file

*After it finishes installing its modules, use the run.bat to turn on the selfbot! It'll say logged in as your tag if it worked correctly.*
